# Infostack


The year 2020 became a new scenario for all of us with the advent of online classes, there arose a need for everything about a student to be digitalised. Infostack is one such app that enables to store information about a student or Faculty member. 

Using our app is so easy. Our app has 2 paths namely one for student and another for faculty member. It is only the faculty member who can add the names of students and create a separate portal whereas faculty member can create one for their own. The portal for the student is created by entering various details of the student such as marks, performance in different activities, CGPA etc... This app can give the details of any registered student in an instant. Students can view their profile by logging in using the credentials given by the faculty member who registered the account. 

Infostack is user friendly application, faculty can handle the information of many students in a ease manner, free of cost and more importantly hassle free information storage.
